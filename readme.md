## Geography Game

### To Do-a-Doodle Do

- ~~Questions component~~
- ~~Create leaderboard~~
- ~~Timeouts, switch between leaderboard and game panels~~
- ~~Refactor this morning~~
- ~~Connect to DB (Atlas? mLab?)~~
- ~~Draw out models, start working with Mongoose~~
- ~~Render saved games to the create game screen~~
- ~~Load in countries (currently async, need to make sure the right answers are fired)~~
- ~~Randomize the answer locations to encourage player engagement~~
- ~~Stop the game when finished, show the final score and disable continue button~~
- ~~Need to create more presentational components, starting with MapContainer~~

- Move timeout bar from player's controller to main game display
- Depending on which game is selected (via click), make call to DB and fetch setup info
- Develop 'Create a game' functionality (route already made)
